### file management

path - readable representation of the location of where my files and folders are present

types

- absolute  - exact location of a file/dir starting from top directory
            - ex - /home/pkp
- relative  - location with respect to current location
            - ex - if you in /pkp then .bashrc's relative loc is `.`

# does this change get reflected?
